Prototype for rankedPro, a Web Application designed to provide data analytics for players of the massive online multiplayer video game League of Legends by Riot Games.
rankedPro utilizes HTTP Requests in JavaScript using the Fetch API to collect data from the Riot Games servers, then processes the data before displaying the relevant statistics to the user.
This repository contains prototype code in the index.html file. This is not proper work at the moment but it is a functioning prototype that accurately collects and displays data straight from the Riot Games server.

As of right now, this project is currently being worked on privately and being implemented server-side using Node.js, but please feel free to take a look at the code in the repository for an idea of how the project is intended to work.

The project is currently up and running on akshay-sud.github.io

Please enter any summoner name into the summoner search box. If you need an example, please use the player "SAVE THE OCEAN"

Please take a look at this Adobe XD prototype to have a better idea of how this project and its UI will appear once completed.
